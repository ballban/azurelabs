# Building Custom VM Images

You can include app deployment with a script when your VMs are created, but there's a downside to that - you add to the deployment time every time you create a new VM. An alternative is to create your own VM image from a VM which has the app already deployed. Then any time you create a new VM it will have the app installed as soon as it comes online.

In this lab we'll create a VM, deploy an application and then create an image from that VM which we can use to create other VMs.

## Create a Base VM

You create an image from a VM - so first you need to prepare the VM with the app deployed.

We'll be deploying a simple Windows application that runs on the IIS Web Server.

ðŸ“‹ Create a Resource Group called `labs-vm-image` and create a Windows Server 2022 Datacenter VM.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

Create the RG in your preferred location:

```
az group create -n labs-vm-image --tags courselabs=azure --location southeastasia
```

Find the SKU for Windows:

```
az vm image list-skus -l westus -p MicrosoftWindowsServer -f WindowsServer -o table
```

Now create the VM with your chosen size, location and SKU:

```
az vm create -l southeastasia -g labs-vm-image -n app01-base --image MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServer:2022-datacenter-core-g2:latest --size Standard_D2s_v5 --admin-username labs --public-ip-address-dns-name <your-unique-dns-name> --admin-password <your-strong-password>
```

</details><br/>

Connect to your VM with a Remote Desktop client, then you can install the application dependencies and the application itself.

You'll get to a terminal session if you used Windows Server Core, or a GUI for the full Windows Server.

Use PowerShell to install the IIS Web Server:

```
Install-WindowsFeature Web-Server,NET-Framework-45-ASPNET,Web-Asp-Net45
```

Remove the default web page and download the application web page:

```
rm -fo C:\inetpub\wwwroot\iisstart.htm

curl -o C:/inetpub/wwwroot/default.aspx https://raw.githubusercontent.com/azureauthority/azure/main/labs/vm-image/app/default.aspx
```

Test the app locally - you should see some simple HTML which includes the name of the VM:

```
curl.exe localhost
```

## Prepare the VM for imaging

That's it for this demo application, but when you build up your base VM you can configure whatever setup your application needs.

Now for a Windows VM you need to run the [Sysprep tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/sysprep--generalize--a-windows-installation?view=windows-11) which generalizes the VM to remove details specific to the machine.

Start the command:

```
C:\windows\system32\sysprep\sysprep.exe
```

Select:

- _Enter System Out-of-Box Experience (OOBE)_
- tick _Generalize_
- and choose _Shutdown_:

![Sysprep screen with options selected](/img/sysprep.png)

> Hit OK and the VM will be generalized and then shut down - you'll lose your Remote Desktop connection.

Next we need to get the VM ready for creating an image. 

ðŸ“‹ Deallocate and generalize the machine using `az vm` commands.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

Deallocating the machine ensures that it is shut down from Azure's perspective:

```
az vm deallocate -g labs-vm-image -n app01-base
```

We have already generalized the VM with Sysprep, but we need to mark it as generalized in Azure:

```
az vm generalize -g labs-vm-image -n app01-base
```

</details><br/>

Print the details of the VM to confirm it is ready to use for an image:

```
az vm show --show-details -g labs-vm-image -n app01-base
```

> The power state should be _VM deallocated_ & no public IP

Now the VM is ready.

## Create an image from the VM

Image creation is straightforward - you name the image you want to create and the VM you want to use.

```
# check the help text:
az image create --help

# if your base image was a generation 2 (gen2) SKU, you need to set that too:
az image create -g labs-vm-image -n app01-image --source app01-base --hyper-v-generation V2
```

This won't take long - effectively the image is just a reference to the OS disk. Check your image is ready:

```
az image list -o table
```

> When it completes, check the VM image in the portal - you have options to create a VM or clone to a new image.

You often want to keep your images in a separate Resource Group, because they have a different lifecyle and you want to retain them if you delete an application RG.

ðŸ“‹ Create a new RG called `labs-vmss-win` **in the same location as your lab RG** and use an `az image` command to copy your image to that RG.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

This is just an ordinary RG:

```
az group create -n labs-vmss-win --location southeastasia
```

The copy command takes source and target parameters:

```
az image copy --help

az image copy --source-type image --source-resource-group labs-vm-image --source-object-name app01-image  --target-location southeastasia --target-resource-group labs-vmss-win
```

</details><br/>

Copying an image can take a while - Azure takes a snapshot of the OS disk and copies it to a temporary storage account. It will start slowly - 1%... 2%... 3% - then suddenly speed up.

> You don't need to wait for this part to complete - open a new terminal window and carry on.

> **BUT** if you see an error from the CLI with `KeyError: 'IMPORT_ENUM'`, this is a [known issue](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/24263). Switch to the Portal and move the VM image to the new RG instead, so we can use the image later.

You can use the normal `vm create` command, using your image name instead of a marketplace URN. 

This will create 3 VMs from your base image:

```
az vm create -g labs-vm-image -n app-n --image app01-image --size Standard_D2s_v5 --admin-username labs  --count 3 -l southeastasia --admin-password <strong-password>
```

Try browsing to the app on one of your VMs, using its public IP address.

## Lab

You can't access the app because the NSG blocks traffic. Add a new rule to allow port 80 and confirm you can reach each of the VMs - you'll see the same page from each, but with a different VM name displayed. These are three instances of the same application, it would be good to have a single DNS address and let Azure load-balance betweeen them. Create a _Traffic Manager Profile_ resource in the Portal and configure it to do that.

## Cleanup

Delete the lab RG **but don't delete the labs-vmss-win RG where you copied the image** (we'll use that in the next lab):

```
az group delete -y -n labs-vm-image
```
