# SQL Server VMs

Managed SQL Server databases take care of a lot of admin tasks and should be your preferred choice, but you can't always use them. They don't support 100% of the features you get with SQL Server in the datacentre, and there will be some occasions where you need a feature that isn't there in the managed options.

In this lab we'll use the SQL VM service, which lets you set up the underlying operating system and the SQL Server deployment however you need to.

## Reference

## Explore Azure SQL in the Portal

Open the Portal and search to create a new Azure SQL resource. Check the details for _SQL Virtual Machines_:

* choose an image - there are Linux & Windows variants, different SQL Server versions and SKUs


We won't go on to create the database in the portal, we'll use the CLI instead.

## Create a Managed SQL Server with the CLI

First we need to create a Resource Group where the new SQL resources will live.

_Create the group - use your own preferred location:_

```
az group create -n labs-sql-vm --tags courselabs=azure -l southeastasia
```

Next we need to find the VM image to use. We'll use SQL Server 2019 Standard on a Windows Server 2022 machine:

```
# find the offers for SQL Server images - this includes Windows and Linux:
az vm image list-offers --publisher MicrosoftSQLServer -o table

# find a SKU:
az vm image list-skus -f sql2019-ws2022 -p MicrosoftSQLServer --location southeastasia -o table

# list all the images, e.g:
az vm image list --sku standard -f sql2019-ws2022 -p MicrosoftSQLServer --location southeastasia -o table --all
```

ðŸ“‹ Create a SQL Server VM using the normal `vm create` command. 

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

This will get you started - be sure to use the latest image version, it will have a URN like this: _MicrosoftSQLServer:sql2019-ws2022:standard:15.0.220913_

```
az vm create -l southeastasia -g labs-sql-vm -n sql01 --image <urn> --size Standard_D2_v3 --admin-username labs --admin-password <your-strong-password> --public-ip-address-dns-name  <your-dns-name> 
```

</details><br/>

If you open the VM in the Portal you'll see it's just a standard VM with no special SQL Server options.

> Check the Network Security Group. SQL Server will be listening on port 1433 - will you be able to access it from the Internet?

Even if you could access the VM, what is the admin username and password? You can't specify SQL Server authentication when you create a normal VM. To add to the management options, you need to register the VM with the [SQL Server IaaS extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/virtual-machines/linux/sql-server-iaas-agent-extension-linux?view=azuresql&tabs=azure-powershell).

## Register the VM for SQL Server Management

The SQL Server extension effectively turns your VM into something more like a managed database service.

ðŸ“‹ Register your VM for SQL Server management using `sql vm create` command. Configure it for public access and set a username and password for SQL Authentication

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

Print the help text:

```
az sql vm create --help
```

You need to specify:

- the VM name - this is the existing VM which is already running SQL Server
- license type - enterprises may have existing SQL Server licences to use
- management type - full, gives you all the management options

This will convert your VM to a SQL Server VM with public access:

```
az sql vm create -g labs-sql-vm -n sql01 --license-type PAYG --sql-mgmt-type Full --connectivity-type PUBLIC --sql-auth-update-username labs --sql-auth-update-pwd <strong-password>
```

</details><br/>

> Now browse to the VM in the Portal - the UI is almost exactly the same... But open the Resource Group and you'll see there's a new SQL Virtual Machine resource.

From the Portal you can see your connectivity setup in the _Security Configuration_ blade:

- set the connectivity to _Public_
- check the NSG and you'll see a new rule has been added to allow incoming traffic on port 1433

## Customize the SQL Server VM

The SQL Server images have SQL Server Management Studio pre-installed, so you can log in and have a UI to work with the database. First you'll need to enable RDP access for the VM. 

ðŸ“‹ Add an NSG rule to allow port 3389 connections from the Internet.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

Find the name of your NSG:

```
az network nsg list -g labs-sql-vm  -o table
```

Check all the details and add the RDP rule:

```
az network nsg rule create -g labs-sql-vm --nsg-name <Your NSG name> -n rdp --priority 150 --source-address-prefixes Internet --destination-port-ranges 3389 --access Allow
```

</details><br/>

Now you can log in to the VM. We'll demonstrate using a SQL Server feature which isn't available on other services - creating a custom function which calls some .NET code.

- copy the [DLL file](/labs/sql-vm/udf/FormattedDate.dll) from your machine to the VM - in the root of the C: drive
- (this binary file contains the .NET code we want to make available through SQL Server)
- run _SQL Server Management Studio_
- the default connection settings use the machine name and Windows auth, which is all fine
- connect and click _New Query_ then run this SQL to register a UDF - User-Defined Function - to call the .NET code

```
sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1
RECONFIGURE
GO

sp_configure 'clr enabled', 1
RECONFIGURE
GO

sp_configure 'clr strict security', 0
RECONFIGURE
GO

CREATE ASSEMBLY FormattedDate FROM 'C:\FormattedDate.dll';  
GO  
  
CREATE FUNCTION LegacyDate() RETURNS NVARCHAR(7)   
AS EXTERNAL NAME FormattedDate.FormattedDate.LegacyNow;   
GO  
```

> Don't worry about all this stuff if you're not a SQL Server guru :) 

You couldn't do this with the other Azure SQL options because you don't have access to upload files to disk, and some of these commands would be restricted.

Now we can test the UDF:

```  
SELECT dbo.LegacyDate();  
GO
```

You'll see the current date in a legacy system format, which was generated by the .NET code you uploaded in the DLL.

## Lab

One other use-case for SQL VMs is that you can own  authentication without using the standard Azure auth, and you can create multiple users with whatever access levels you need. 

Create a new SQL Server login with a username and password. Confirm you can access the database server from your own machine using those credentials, and run the `SELECT dbo.LegacyDate()` query.

## Cleanup

Delete the RG with this command to remove all the resources:

```
az group delete -y -n labs-sql-vm
```
